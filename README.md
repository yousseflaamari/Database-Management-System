## Big Data Project: Database Creation and Queries

---

## Project Overview

This project involves the creation of a relational database for managing developers, projects, software, and their realizations. The database schema includes several tables with constraints and relationships, and it demonstrates various SQL operations such as creating tables, inserting data, and running specific queries to retrieve information.

## Components

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Table Creation**:
   - Creating tables with primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
   - Ensuring data integrity through the use of checks and unique constraints.

2. **Data Insertion**:
   - Inserting sample data into the `Developpeur`, `Projet`, `Logiciel`, and `Realisation` tables.
   - Demonstrating the relationships between tables with the inserted data.

3. **Queries**:
   - Executing various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate data.
   - Examples include selecting software based on price, finding developers involved in specific projects, and ordering realizations by budget.
